    "### 3D Video Classification using OpenCV and Tensorflow\n",
    "\n",
    "We will parse video data from the camera of the user's device using OpenCV and develop a (2+1)D CNN to classify the user's exercise amongst fundamental Calisthenics/Compound lift exercises (Squats, Deadlifts, Pullups, Ring dips/pushups, etc.). This will involve using Tensorflow and Keras API to convert video data into a series of images allowing us to detect which body parts are in use to distinguish amongst these exercises. The advantage of classifying the exercise is so that the user does not have to navigate the website to select the exercise they are doing between sets simplyfing the workout significantly."
